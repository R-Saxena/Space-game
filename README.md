# Space-game
This is a simple HTML5 canvas game called Space Demo. It consists of enemies falling from the sky, and a player who must kill them by firing bullets to win the game. Player can move left and right using the arrow keys and can fire bullets using the space bar. Player should make sure that none of the enemies touches the ground, else he will lose.

I created this project in Feb 2019 because, I got this as an assignment in Nagarro Campus Learning Program.

**There are no dependencies to run this project. You just have to download it and run the index.html file.**
Enjoy your Game ...!!!
